# Project
#### The idea we had for this project is to build a service where people can have a place to keep track of and show off the the things that they own or want in an organized manner.  Someone could use SuperSet if they wanted to show off their shoe collection, or they want to show off their car and all the parts that go into it, or even if they just wanted to use it as a wishlist to keep track of the things they still want/need to get.
